# Netflix Serial Killers RSS Feed Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project consists of the creation of an **RSS 2.0 feed** developed using **Visual Studio Code**, based on four popular Netflix series focused on real-life serial killers. The goal is to understand the structure and functionality of RSS feeds while applying it to a compelling and contemporary topic from streaming media.

The RSS feed presents curated information about each series, including a title, description, and unique link, allowing users or feed readers to consume the content in a structured and standardized format.
