# No podrás dormir: The Terrifying Rise of the Platform's 4 Most Wanted Killers 

## 📝 Project Description
This project is an informative web platform designed with a horror aesthetic, dedicated to analyzing four of the most notorious criminals portrayed in Netflix's documentary and fiction series. Through an analytical lens, the site examines the crimes of **Jeffrey Dahmer, Ed Gein, the Menéndez brothers, and John Wayne Gacy**, reflecting on why these disturbing productions capture such intense public interest.

The platform features a content syndication channel (RSS) that summarizes their stories, provides official links, and details the impact of their cases on popular culture and the justice system.

* **CSS3**: Employed for the visual design, featuring a dark theme, 'Courier New' typography, grayscale-to-color image transitions, and modal windows managed via the `:target` pseudo-class.
